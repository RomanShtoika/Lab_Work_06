# Lab_Work_06
# Description
This project involves the following tasks:

1. Create a Person class that contains:

a) fields fullName, age.

b) the move() and talk() methods, in which it is simple to display the message -"Such and such a Person is speaking" on the console.

c) Add two constructors - Person() and Person(fullName, age).

Create two objects of this class. One object is initialized by the Person() constructor, the other by Person(fullName, age).

2. Phone class.

a) Create a Phone class that contains the number, model, and weight fields.

b) Create three instances of this class.

c) Display the values of their variables on the console.

d) Add methods to the Phone class: receiveCall, has one parameter - the name of the caller. Displays the message “{name} is calling” on the console. getNumber - returns the phone number. Call these methods for each of the objects.

e) Add a constructor to the Phone class, which accepts three parameters for initializing the class fields - number, model and weight.

f) Add a constructor that accepts two parameters for initializing class fields - number, model.

g) Add a constructor without parameters.

c) Add an overloaded receiveCall method that accepts two parameters - the caller's name (the caller) and the phone number. Call this method.

k) Create a sendMessage method with variable-length arguments. This method accepts as input phone numbers to which the message will be sent. The method outputs the numbers of these phones to the console.

3. Implement the hierarchy:

4. Create an abstract Car class with fields model, color and maximum speed.

The class also contains methods: "regular" gas(), which simply displays some text on the screen (n-d, "We're gassing!") and an abstract method for braking void brake().
Implement derived classes Sedan and Truck.

Create objects of the Sedan and Truck classes. Execute methods on behalf of created objects.

5. Individual tasks according to the option:

5.10. Create a class that describes mail sorting. Class data: city, street, house, apartment, number of parcels, cost. 

Open functions of the class: data input, data output, calculation of the total number of parcels and the total cost.

6. Based on the class specified in task 5, according to the option, create a successor class that extends the capabilities of the parent class.

Add two fields to the newly created class (which ones exactly? - come up with your own), as well as redefine the function of displaying class data on the screen.
